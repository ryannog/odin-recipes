        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly coat a 3-quart casserole dish 
                or 9x13 pan with butter or spray with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook macaroni according to package directions, adding 2 
                minutes to the maximum time listed on the package. 
                Drain; stir butter into macaroni until butter is melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                While macaroni is boiling, shred both cheese blocks using 
                a box grater. Combine shredded cheese until evenly mix, 
                then set aside about half of shredded cheese mixture for later.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together mascarpone and evaporated milk 
                until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the whole milk, followed by the salt, creole seasoning, 
                mustard powder, and nutmeg. Stir in half of the shredded cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taste mixture to see if seasonings are to your preference and adjust 
                if necessary. Stir in beaten egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add buttered macaroni to milk/cheese mixture and stir to combine. 
                Pour the whole mixture into your prepared casserole dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle remaining shredded cheese evenly over the top, 
                followed by some fresh cracked pepper, if you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until cheese on top is 
                melted and browned, and filling is bubbling. Cool slightly before 
                serving.
            </li>
